# Self-sequence-alignment

Self-sequence alignment represents a novel [mathematical model](https://figshare.com/articles/figure/Self-Sequence_Alignment_-_Implementation_vs_model_pdf/19205139) for measuring the information content in biological sequences, such as DNA, RNA, or proteins. Nevertheless, the use of this model is not limited to biological sequences. Thus, any symbol inside a sequence can be considered. The information content is calculated using a dedicated function ùúé(s), which provides values expressed in percentages, where 100% represents the highest information content and zero the lowest. Two principles are explored: A global principle whereby a single value is obtained for a sequence of any length and a local approach in which a series of values are used to construct signals along the sequence.
